## Sample Analytics Demonstrated

### 1. Product Catalog Overview
```sql
-- Total products, unique codes, web-ready, with analogues
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_products,
    COUNT(DISTINCT vendor_code) as unique_vendor_codes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN is_for_web = true THEN product_id END) as products_on_web,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN has_analogue = true THEN product_id END) as products_with_alternatives
FROM staging_staging.stg_product
WHERE deleted = false;
```

**Result**: 115 total, 114 unique codes, 115 web-ready, 77 with analogues

### 2. Semantic Product Search
```sql
-- Find 10 most similar products to product 7807552
WITH target AS (
    SELECT embedding FROM analytics_features.product_embeddings
    WHERE product_id = 7807552
)
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, 1 - (e.embedding <=> t.embedding) as similarity
FROM analytics_features.product_embeddings e
CROSS JOIN target t
JOIN staging_staging.stg_product p ON p.product_id = e.product_id
WHERE e.product_id != 7807552
ORDER BY similarity DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result**: Top 5 products have 99.5-99.6% similarity (identical descriptions)

### 3. Data Quality Dashboard
```sql
-- Field completeness by major fields
SELECT field_name, populated, total, pct_complete
FROM (
    SELECT 'Vendor Code' as field_name,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN vendor_code IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as populated,
           COUNT(*) as total,
           ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN vendor_code IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as pct_complete
    FROM staging_staging.stg_product WHERE deleted = false
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Polish Name',
           COUNT(CASE WHEN name_pl IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END),
           COUNT(*),
           ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN name_pl IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2)
    FROM staging_staging.stg_product WHERE deleted = false
) completeness
ORDER BY field_name;
```

**Result**: All critical fields show 100% completeness

### 4. Supplier Distribution
```sql
-- Products by supplier prefix
SELECT
    LEFT(vendor_code, 4) as supplier_prefix,
    COUNT(*) as product_count,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM staging_staging.stg_product
WHERE deleted = false AND vendor_code IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY LEFT(vendor_code, 4)
ORDER BY product_count DESC;
```

**Result**: SEM1 (50 products, 43.48%), SABO (41 products, 35.65%)
